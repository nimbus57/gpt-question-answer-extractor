            "ChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\n\nThe Group by feature in Windows Explorer has been around since Windows Vista, which was released in 2007. It was introduced as part of the broader set of file management improvements in that version of Windows, including new ways to sort, group, and view files. Before Vista, earlier versions of Windows like XP didn't have as much flexibility with grouping files by date, size, type, or other properties.\n\nThe feature became more refined and prominent in later versions, especially in Windows 7 and beyond, where it started becoming more integrated with the layout and view options in File Explorer.\n\n4o"
